/*************************************************************

You should implement your request handler function in this file.

requestHandler is already getting passed to http.createServer()
in basic-server.js, but it won't work as is.

You'll have to figure out a way to export this function from
this file and include it in basic-server.js so that it actually works.

*Hint* Check out the node module documentation at http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html.

  // Request and Response come from node's http module.
  //
  // They include information about both the incoming request, such as
  // headers and URL, and about the outgoing response, such as its status
  // and content.
  //
  // Documentation for both request and response can be found in the HTTP section at
  // http://nodejs.org/documentation/api/

  // Do some basic logging.
  //
  // Adding more logging to your server can be an easy way to get passive
  // debugging help, but you should always be careful about leaving stray
  // console.logs in your code.

  // anything back to the client until you do. The string you pass to
  // response.end() will be the body of the response - i.e. what shows
  // up in the browser.
  //
  // Calling .end "flushes" the response's internal buffer, forcing
  // node to actually send all the data over to the client.

// Another way to get around this restriction is to serve you chat
